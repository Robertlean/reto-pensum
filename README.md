# Pensum

## Objective
Obtain the graph representation of a structured data for the list in [pensum.json](https://gitlab.com/jmpelaez/reto-pensum/-/raw/main/curso1.json).

A valid entry is a single page web application written in HTML5, CSS3 and plain Javascript (any open source frameworks or libraries may be used). The page must present the graph as SVG interconnected shapes. Connecting lines are optional. The shapes shown here are indicative only. An example of a valid end result is:

###Observations

- The project was not very difficult for me to start and understand the Json file. What got complicated for me is the arrangement of the cards in the order as referenced in the image.
But the challenge itself, I found it very entertaining and good to speed up memory. Thank you very much for letting me participate in this challenge.
